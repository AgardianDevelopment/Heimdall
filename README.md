# **Heimdallr**
>__**Multipurpose, Functional, Ever watching**__

>*Notice*: This repo is a complete rewrite of Heimdallr built upon [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [Discord-Akairo](https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/).Some fuctionality may no longer be compatible due to the API in use (e.g. Imgur with NSFW photos).

To join our community or just look for help please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/E9cJjvw).

## Self-hosting
We highly encourage you to invite this bot over self-hosting. Self-hosting aka running the bot provided within this repo on your own is permitted but not supported. Source code is provided in the interest of being open with our community. Ultimately no help or guidance will be provided for setup, editing, or any actions from running the bot within your own self-hosted enviroment. You are more then welcome to join the support server but understand any issues or questions stemming from self-hosting may be ignored or disregarded entirely. If you still wish to continue to self host the bot you will need at the very least the following:

* Discord Developer Application
* Node v12.0.0+
* PostgrSQL
* Creation of .env file (a sample can be provided upon request)
* API keys used for services
* Some minor editing (i.e. errors from unlisted bots and etc.)

> *Notice*: Repeated requests for aid with self-hosting will lead to a ban from the support server.
